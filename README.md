# gthousingnotify

This project was created in Summer 2020, out of my need of getting notified of housing openings during the beginning of the school year. Specifically designed to scrape the housing update website of Georgia Tech. Could be applied to more types of housing. Sends an email to your email if a specified room or dorm room opens up during the housing assigning phase.
